The Field Trip is a directory of hidden gems and unique spaces in Chicago. Sometimes we need little a push to shake up our routines and open ourselves up to new experiences. I created this application for Chicagoans who are looking to have new adventures by exploring beautiful, unfamiliar locations throughout the city. The application allows users to view the entire directory without creating an account, but once they do create an account, they gain the functionality to save individual locations to their list of favorite places, submit their own favorite places to the directory database, and delete the places that they have submitted.
